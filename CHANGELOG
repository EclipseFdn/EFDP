# ChangeLog

## [2020] - 2020-01-20

### Removed
- All references to the Eclipse Planning Council have been removed
- The entire section 4.8, which quoted text from the bylaws regarding councils has been removed (the "Terms" section covers this)

### Changes
- A reference to the bylaws was added in the definition of the Eclipse Architecture Council.

## [2018] - 2018-12-14

### Added
- A separate section that formally defines key terms has been added.
- The notion of a Progress Review added to augment (and in some cases, replace) Release Reviews (Bug 496321).
- Added a requirement that the Project Team must provide (either directly or indirectly) a link between the distribution form of Release artifacts and the corresponding source code.
- A CHANGELOG based on "keep a changelog" https://keepachangelog.com/

### Removed
- Removed redundant restriction that Permanent Incubators cannot participate in the simultaneous release (they can't release at all).
- Removed discussion regarding specific labeling of Milestones and Release Candidates (replaced with an simple statement that Milestones and Release Candidates must be labeled as such with examples)

### Changes
- Converted document source format to Asciidoctor.
- The time period for votes and reviews is expressed in terms of simple weeks rather than "one week of generally accepted business days" which is unnecessarily complicated.
- Removed the unnecessary statement that "Major releases continue to go through release reviews." from the description of the Mature Phase.
- Content in the Releases section has been reorganized.
- Release Reviews have been recast as a special type of Progress Review.
- The requirement that a project engage in a Release Review prior to a release has been changed to a requirement that project can only release within a year of successfully engaging in either a Progress Review or a Release Review. Further, the Project Leadership Chain is granted the ability to compel a project to engage in a Progress Review.
- The requirement that the "the IP Policy has been followed and all approvals have been received" has been moved from being a requirement of a Release Review to being a requirement of a Release. This is a bit subtle, but important given that with the introduction of a Progress Review a project may issue Releases without engaging in a Release Review.
- Content in the Releases section has been reorganized so that the three exceptions are grouped followed by the discussion regarding milestones.
- The notion "public comments" has been generalized to "feedback" in the Reviews section (Bug 538613).
- Change the title of section 2.3.1 to "Developers", and section 4.7 to "Committers" (Bug 484587).
- References to "Bug fix Releases" changed to "Service Releases" in the Releases section.

## [2015] - 2015-12-31

### Changes
- Make the process of retiring/removing project members explicit (Bug 376001).
- Streamline review requirements (Bug 415620).
- Rewrite the section on requirements to be more clear and succinct (Bug 416185).
- Appointed members of the Architecture Council are appointed to two (Bug 418208) year renewable terms.
- Include "Freedom of Action" requirement in the EDP (Bug 471367).
- Generalize the expected output of projects (Bug 477238).
- Include definitions of terms required by other legal documents (Bug 480526).
- Only one mentor required for an incubating project (Bug 463850).
